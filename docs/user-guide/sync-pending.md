# Syncing Pending Records

Because the app is **offline-first**, records you create in the field are first saved on the device and then uploaded to the server. This page explains how to review and clear those pending records.

## 1. Why records are pending

When there is no connection — or when a bracelet still needs to be written — new patients and updates are stored **locally** and queued for synchronization. The home screen shows a **gold badge** with the number of records still pending (including any duplicates or records with errors).

## 2. The sync queue

Open **Pending to sync** from the home screen. Each record is shown as a card with a clear status:

- **Pending** — waiting to be uploaded.
- **Error** — the upload did not complete; the card explains, in plain language, what to do.
- **Duplicate** — the record matches one already on the server.

## 3. Synchronize

- Tap **Sync now** on a single record, or **Sync all** to upload the whole queue.
- Tap **Review** to inspect a record before syncing.

When a record uploads successfully, it leaves the queue and the home badge count goes down.

**Note:** Technical system-error details are intentionally hidden from this screen to keep it clear. When you sign out, the app warns you if records are still pending — sync them first whenever possible so nothing is left only on the device.
