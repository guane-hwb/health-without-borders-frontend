# User Guide

This guide is for the **healthcare staff** who use the Health Without Borders mobile app in the field — during medical brigades and at pilot sites. It explains, step by step, how to register patients, read and update their records with NFC/QR bracelets, and keep everything synchronized.

No technical knowledge is required. If you are looking for API, architecture, or deployment documentation, see the **Development** and **Infrastructure and Security** sections instead.

## What the app does

Health Without Borders stores a patient's clinical record on an **NFC/QR bracelet** and keeps a synchronized copy on the server. Because brigades often work without a stable internet connection, the app is **offline-first**: you can register patients and record care with no signal, and the app will synchronize automatically when a connection is available.

A single patient has **one shared record** across all participating organizations, so any authenticated professional can read and update it at the point of care.

## Before you start

- A mobile device with **NFC enabled** (Android) and the app installed.
- Your **login credentials**, provided by your organization administrator.
- Patient **NFC bracelets** and, when applicable, **guardian cards**.

**Note:** The interface is available in **Spanish and English**. You can switch the language at any time from the header (see [Getting Started](getting-started.md)).
